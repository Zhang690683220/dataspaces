Requirements
============
1. DataSpaces requires MPI. 


Quick Installation Instructions
===============================
The following steps are needed to configure, bulid and install DataSpaces.

1. Configure
# Examples for the configure command on supported architectures and networks. Please customize it according to your specific system configurations and environments.
# Gemini for Cray XE and XK series
$ ./configure CC=cc FC=ftn

# Infiniband cluster
$ ./configure CC=mpicc FC=mpif90

# DCMF for IBM BlueGene/P
$ ./configure CC=mpixlc FC=mpixlf90 CFLAGS="-g -O0 -qarch=450 -qtune=450" --with-dcmf="/bgsys/drivers/ppcfloor"

# PAMI for IBM BlueGene/Q
$ ./configure CC=/bgsys/drivers/ppcfloor/comm/xl/bin/mpixlc_r FC=/bgsys/drivers/ppcfloor/comm/xl/bin/mpixlf90 CFLAGS="-O0 -g -qlanglvl=extc99 -O3 -qarch=qp -qtune=qp -qfullpath"

# Portals for Cray XT series
$ ./configure CC=cc FC=ftn

2. Some of the useful configure options
 --preifx=/install/path - Set the directory where DataSpaces will be installed.

 --enable-dimes - Build DataSpaces with DIstributed MEmory Space (DIMES) support.
   DIMES feature uses local RDMA memory buffers across application processes to build
   a virtual shared data space in-situ, which can be queried and directly accessed by 
   other applications in a data coupling workflow. Currently this feature is only 
   supported on Cray Gemini and IBM DCMF networks. 

3. Build & Install 
# Under project top dir
$ make
$ make install
